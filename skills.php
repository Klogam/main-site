    <h1>Programming Languages</h1>
    <p class="first"> The languages I currently know are C, Python, Java, Assembly (x86 and x64, AT&T syntax), PHP, and HTML. I have
    extremely minimal experience with C++, Lisp, and Smalltalk but want to learn more about C++. I am currently taking a course that 
    will cover Javascript, HTML5, CSS, Java Servlets, and JSP.</p>
	<p class="first">
	The language that I know the most about is C. I have taken 3 classes on strictly using C, 
	and a fourth class where we used C a little bit but moved on to assembly. I enjoy writing
	programs in C, the low level abilities of C make it more challenging to write, which is what
	I enjoy about it. I have extremely minimal experience with C++, only enough experience to
	be able to classify myself as a beginner with it. Besides the three class, I was also a grader
	for a class on C and had to grade student assignments and assist them with any previous or future
	assignments.  I also know some about assembly, however I would have to look at some references to
	make sure I have calling conventions correct (Such as which registers to use when calling a function) and
	various other instructions documentation to make sure I am using them correctly. As far as assembly,
	I have some experience with 32 and 64 bit assembly on the Linux platform using AT&T syntax. Most of
	my C programming has been done on a Linux system, and I also have experience using various linux
	system calls. </p>
	<p class="first">
	My second most known language is Java, with only one class taken exlusively on it, however
	have used it in multiple other classes for programs. I would use Java over C as before you start  programming
	any project you have to evaluate the criteria that is necessary to fit, such as whether you need execution speed
	or speed on writing it if a deadline is coming up, or if OOP is necessary, and after evaluting the class assignment
	Java would be the best fit. I was a tutor for the Java class New Mexico Tech offers, and I would hold
	office hours and assist any students with problems they had with the assignment.</p>
	<p class="first">
	Python was the first language I learned, however my experience with it is currently at a beginner level. If necessary and
	given a few days, I could catch up to speed and become much more experienced with it. I also have very limited experience with
	HTML and PHP, this website and the one after it is aimed to teach me about both of them. I have very limited experience with SQL,
	for a software engineering class my group made a website which used PHP, MySQL, and HTML/CSS</p>
	<p class="first">
	I have also taken or currently taking courses on Algorithms and Data Structures, Networking, Neural Networks, Computer Architecture, Principles of Programming Languages, Software Engineering, Formal Languages and Automata, Computer System Organization, Foundations of Computer Science, Systems Programming, and Internet and Web Programming. </p>
	<h1>Other Skills</h1>
	<p class="first">
		I have experience with Microsoft Office products and LaTeX, and I would rather work in LaTeX due to the ease of
		adding equations and mathematical entities, and the ACM format for LaTeX is very easy to work with. I have experience
		with both Linux and Windows systems, I have extensively used Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, and 10. The Linux distros I 
		have experience with are Fedora, Mint, Ubuntu, and Arch. I am also proficient with Git.
