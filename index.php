    <h1> About Me</h1>
	<p class="first"> My name is Kasey Maberry and I am currently a senior Computer Science major at 
	New Mexico Tech with an expected graduation date of December 2017. I have been using computers daily
	ever since I was six years old, it all started when my older brother introduced me to the video game
	Diablo II developed by Blizzard North and published by Blizzard Entertainment in 2002. 
	Shortly after that in either 2003 or 2004 I purchased a game known as StarCraft, a real time strategy game
	developed and published
	by Blizzard Entertainment. StarCraft is where my interest in Computer Science began, there are player made
	maps that you can create and share with other players and this is where first encountered a very basic form of programming. Although 
	the programming part was very simple, there was a list of premade triggers and each one was selected. Each
	began with a conditional, and then if that was true then the action took place. For example, an extremely popular
	trigger that I used in multiple maps was if a unit walked into a certain zone they would be
	teleported to somewhere else, all of it was very simple and easy to make. I really enjoyed making maps, I would end
	up spending more times creating a map then actually playing the game, and I made these maps for several years.
	After that I knew I wanted to be a computer scientist, and in high school I took two introductory 
	classes that I really enjoyed, one was for C++ and the other was for Python. I do not really remember much
	from them. I started attending New Mexico Tech in Fall of 2013, and it will take me a total of 9 semesters to
	graduate. I currently have a 3.31 GPA and have completed 6 semester. As of right now I do not have a specific preference for what I want to
	do once I graduate, however I find lower level programming such as C and Assembly to be incredibly interesting.
	I also find security to  be interesting. Over the summer I plan on learning about reverse engineering, as
	I also enjoy reading other source code and trying to figure out how it works. Back when I was making maps in
	StarCraft I essentially learned everything by going through other maps and reading how they worked, with very
	few tutorials on how it worked. Unfortunately, I do not have any of the maps I made for StarCraft as the
	harddrive of that computer failed a couple of years ago after nearly 10 years of use.

	 <h1> About this Website </h1>
	<p class="first"> This website was created to display up to date information about myself, and to list all
	of my applicable skills on projects. On the left side is a navigation bar, this page is About. The projects
	page will contain all of my projects. Skills will contain a look at all of my skills, while the Resume link
	contains my resume. The goal of the skills page is to have a more elaborate defintion of my skills than what 
	my resume contains. Contact contains basic contact information. This is currently version 1 of the website,
	with no formal training in HTML or CSS. In the Fall 2016 I am taking a class on web programming and hopefully
	I will learn more about HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, and whatever other tools I might need. Future iterations of
	this website may use Bootstrap or another tool to make it more appealing.

	<!--<p>This is the first draft. This page will contain information about me and  The background was obtained from www.subtlepatterns.com. A script to have the server automatically pull from git was obtained from https://github.com/markomarkovic/simple-php-git-deploy/
