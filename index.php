    <h1> About Me</h1>
	<p class="first"> My name is Kasey Maberry and I am currently a senior Computer Science major at 
	New Mexico Tech with an expected graduation date of December 2017. I have been using computers daily
	ever since I was six years old, it all started when my older brother introduced me to the video game
	Diablo II developed by Blizzard North and published by Blizzard Entertainment in 2002. 
	Shortly after that in either 2003 or 2004 I purchased a game known as StarCraft, a real time strategy game
	developed and published
	by Blizzard Entertainment. StarCraft is where my interest in Computer Science began, there are player made
	maps that you can create and share with other players and this is where first encountered a very basic form of programming. The programming part was very simple, there was a list of premade "triggers", which were the instructions. Each
	began with a conditional, and then if that was true then the action took place. For example, an extremely popular
	trigger that I used in multiple maps was if a unit walked into a certain zone they would be
	teleported to somewhere else, all of it was very simple and easy to make. I really enjoyed making maps, I would end
	up spending more times creating a map then actually playing the game, and I made these maps for several years.
	After that I knew I wanted to be a computer scientist, and in high school I took two introductory 
	classes that I really enjoyed, one was for C++ and the other was for Python. I do not really remember much
	from them. I started attending New Mexico Tech in Fall of 2013, and it will take me a total of 9 semesters to
	graduate. I currently have a 3.31 GPA and have completed 6 semesters. As of right now I do not have a specific preference for what I want to
	do once I graduate, however I find lower level programming such as C and Assembly to be incredibly interesting.
	I also find security to be interesting. Reverse engineering is also something I find fun and something I wish to learn, in one course
	we had to exploit programs that the professor gave us by reverse engineering and it was extremely fun and something I wish to learn more about.
	 Back when I was making maps in
	StarCraft I essentially learned everything by going through other maps and reading how they worked, with very
	few tutorials on how it worked. Unfortunately, I do not have any of the maps I made for StarCraft as the
	harddrive of that computer failed a couple of years ago after nearly 10 years of use.
